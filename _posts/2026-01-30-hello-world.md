This is my first blog post. I'm starting this to share notes on papers I'm reading, ideas I'm exploring, and things I'm thinking about.

Writing helps me think more clearly[^1]. The act of explaining something forces me to understand it deeply. And if these notes help someone else along the way, even better.

[^1]: This is a sidenote. On wide screens it appears in the left margin, on mobile it's a regular footnote at the bottom.

## What to expect

Mostly short, informal notes about:

- **Paper breakdowns** - Distilling interesting research papers into their core ideas
- **Half-baked thoughts** - Ideas I'm exploring that aren't fully formed yet
- **Technical notes** - Things I learned that might be useful to others

I'm not aiming for polish. These are working notes, not essays.

## Why write publicly?

There's something about knowing others might read your work that raises the bar. You can't handwave past the parts you don't understand. You have to actually figure them out.

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

That quote is usually attributed to Einstein, though he probably never said it. Still, the sentiment holds.

## How this works

The setup is intentionally minimal. Markdown files, Jekyll, deployed on push. No analytics, no comments, no complexity. Just writing.

The constraint is useful. When publishing is frictionless, the only barrier is having something worth saying.
